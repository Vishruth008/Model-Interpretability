# Model-Interpretability

## Overview
This project involves building and interpreting different types of machine learning models to understand their predictions. We utilize a linear model, a tree-based model, and an AutoML solution to find the best model. Additionally, we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to explain the outputs of these models, providing insights into the impact of features.

## Objectives
1. **Linear Model**: Fit a linear model and interpret the regression coefficients to understand how each feature contributes to the outcome.
2. **Tree-Based Model**: Fit a tree-based model and interpret the nodes to explore decision rules used by the model.
3. **AutoML**: Use an AutoML tool to find the best performing model, simplifying the model selection process.
4. **SHAP Analysis**: Run SHAP analysis on the models from steps 1, 2, and 3 to interpret the SHAP values and compare them with other model interpretability methods.

## Key Questions Addressed
- What is the significance of each predictor in the linear model?
- How do the decision nodes contribute to the tree-based modelâ€™s predictions?
- Which model performs best using AutoML, and what are its key attributes?
- How do SHAP values help in explaining the impact of features in each model?
- How do these interpretations compare to traditional methods?

## Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, SHAP, H2O.ai, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.
- **Environment**: Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project
1. **Open the Notebook**: 
   - Open the provided `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. **Run All Cells**: 
   - Ensure that all cells run without errors and that the dataset is loaded correctly.
3. **SHAP Analysis**:
   - Follow along with the SHAP analysis steps to interpret the models and compare the results.

## Deliverables
